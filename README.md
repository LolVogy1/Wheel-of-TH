# Wheel-of-TH
A program to create a random Fire Emblem: Three Houses lineup 

The program decides what route to play and generates your lineup accordingly

Rules:
The default setting uses the units from your house and gives a random advanced/special/master class to each unit.

Units can only be given classes they can actually use (males can't be given falcon knight, for example).

Lords and units with unique classes (Byleth, Jeritza) also have a chance of being given these classes.

An additional 3 random units are generated that can be recuited at any time.

For the Blue Lions I neglected to include Gilbert as he effectively replaces Dedue, it's up to you whether to continue using him.
